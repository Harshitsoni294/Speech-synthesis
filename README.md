# 🗣️ Text-to-Speech with Tacotron2 + HiFi-GAN

Welcome to the future of voice generation! This project is a powerful and efficient **Text-to-Speech (TTS)** system that converts written text into realistic human-like speech—trained on **my own voice** using **Tacotron2** for mel-spectrogram generation and **HiFi-GAN** for high-quality waveform synthesis.

## 💡 What makes it awesome?

- 🎙️ **Personal Voice Cloning** — The model mimics *my own voice*, making it feel like magic.
- 🧠 **Tacotron2 + HiFi-GAN** — A powerhouse duo for natural, expressive, and crisp voice synthesis.
- ⚡ **Fast & Lightweight** — Perfectly optimized for fast inference and smooth deployment.
- 🎛️ **Gradio UI** — Intuitive, browser-based interface for seamless interaction.
- ☁️ **Deployed on Hugging Face Spaces** — No local setup required!
